\begin{java}
public void f(int arr[]) {
    int total=0;
    for (int i=0;i<arr.length;++i) {
        total+=arr[i];
        i++;
    }
    System.out.println(total);
}
\end{java}
What would be output to the terminal if f was called with the array \{1,2,3,3,5,6,7\}?

\begin{subtopic}{2}
\textbf{Note:} Terminal means screen/console/output window
\end{subtopic}

\begin{subtopic}{3}
Note that \textbf{i} is incremented in both the afterthought and loop body.

$1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 5$
